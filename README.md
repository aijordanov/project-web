# Overview
# The client wants you to establish the groundwork systems and approaches that their future (more junior) hires can use as a guide to best practice.
# 
# They provide a sample movie reviews database and would like you to:
# 
# build a simple website to ask a user for their movie preferences
# build an api which provides recommendations
# build and complete a test system around the recommendations api to verify it is correct
# build and deploy the final website/api products to the cloud
# establish that the cloud system can be scaled if needed
